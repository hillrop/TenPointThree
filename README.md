Learn as I go.

I'm learning App Script with Google sheets. Now I'm interested in Linux. At least on this day. 
I have a chromebook with  developer mode turned on. 
I was pretty good in MS Access, back in the day, and I used to know a little VBA code. That was years ago. I have recently discovered Google sheets and app script. Completley different from everything known to me. But when I finally got something to work, I kinda got hooked. 

So Where am I, in regards to app script code?  Still pretty basic. sheet.getRange, get and set value(s) ect. I understand the basics of a 2D Array and for loops. I'm not an expert and never will be and I don't care. It's still fun. 
So now you're wondering why? If you answered: "Nope, I don't I don't give a shit." Then, thank you. That saved time. I'm sure that free time from unemployment had something to do with it.

What are my goals? I don't know. 

How old Im I? Do you remember Dos? Qbasic? 5-1/2 floppies?

What do I wanna be when I grow up? A beer guzzlin redneck that loves sci fi and DnD? 
Livin the dream . . .
